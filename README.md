# AngularPlayground

This project documents the first phase of my learning journey into Angular. The inspiration for this project was the [React Playground](https://benjamingro.github.io/react-playground/#/myfirstcomponents) that I created for the MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course. I re-wrote all of the React components in Angular as a self-learning exercise. 

 This project was generated with the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). If you want to run this project locally, then fork this repository, run 'npm install' to install dependancies and then 'ng serve' inside the project folder on your local machine.

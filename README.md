# AngularPlayground

This project documents the first phase of my learning journey into Angular. The inspiration for this project was the [React Playground](https://benjamingro.github.io/react-playground/#/myfirstcomponents) that I created for the MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course. I re-wrote all of the React components in Angular as a self-learning exercise. 

 This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.3. If you want to run this project locally, then fork this repository, run 'npm install' to install dependancies and then 'ng serve' inside the project folder on your local machine.
